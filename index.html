        I recieved a job offer mid-course, and the subjects 
        I learned were current, if not more so, in the company 
        I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

      <p>"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
        I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some 
        people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for 
        the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
        shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best-and most 
        grueling-time of my life. Since completing the course, I've
        successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer 
        at a VR startup."</p>

      Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.

      to be able to go out in the world and present

      you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing

    <h2>
      Such a life-changing exprience. Highly recommeded!
    </h2>
    <p>"Before joined the bootcamp.I've never written a line of 
      code.I needed some structure from professionals who can 
      help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged 
      to enroll by a former student of their who can only say 
      wonderful things about the program. The entire curricum 
      and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and 
      I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
      project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning 
      to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. 
      In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an 
      example of my land a job as a full-stack developer after 
      recieving multiple offers. 100% recommed! "
